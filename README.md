# 🌐 Web Fundamentals Deep Dive

**A self-guided journey into the core of web development — no frameworks, no libraries, no bundlers. Just HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and raw Node.js.**

## 🎯 Why This Exists

I'm building this project series to truly understand the core of web development — without depending on frameworks, libraries, or build tools.

Instead of jumping straight into React, Express, or bundlers, I want to:

Learn how the browser really works with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Master the DOM, Web APIs, and client-side routing.

Write Node.js servers from scratch, including custom routing, query parsing, and handling HTTP.

Build layouts and UI with responsive, semantic HTML and modern CSS.

Create small, reusable components and eventually write my own mini JavaScript framework.

This journey is about building everything from the ground up — to gain real fluency with the web platform.
